# headscale-operator

A Kubernetes Operator to instantiate and control headscale instances.

## Description

With _headscale-operator_ you can instantiate multiple [headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) servers for multiple purpose.

_headscale-operator_ let you manage [_namespaces_](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/blob/main/docs/glossary.md) and _preauthkeys_.

## Getting Started

You’ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
 
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/headscale-operator:tag
```
 
1. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/headscale-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

1. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
